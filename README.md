##Caesar Cipher Lab

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Learn more about it at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

You'll be writing a caeser encoder and decoder. Your application will have text fields for a message and an offset. A capital letter is always converted to a capital letter. This means that a capital Z with an offset of 2 is converted to a B. Spaces and punctuation are ignored.
